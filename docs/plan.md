# A New American Revolution

The idea behind _The Revolution Will Be Live_ is that an organization so diametrically opposed to the existing system that it would take power via a coup in other countries rises to prominence in the U.S. through the election of President with a radically different platform.

## Developing the Systems

The way that the software backing the changes are written using a continuous serial model. Work is done via pair programming live-streamed to the internet. Pairs of programmers forward the development of issues by contributing to branches.

At the end of each session there is an overlap with the next pair of programmers. They discuss their status and expected next steps. The first team commits and pushes all their changes regardless of completeness.
