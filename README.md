# Coorditang

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project which aims to create a multitiered [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com) distribution where a top-level circle decides how many tokens go to each guild, and then guild circles determine the distribution to participants.

This data is transformed from multiple circles in Coordinape to an [External Plugin graph for SourceCred](https://observablehq.com/d/1503da36e421ea78).

Between the Coordinape distributions and SourceCred graph, the data is loaded into a Google Sheet for review.
